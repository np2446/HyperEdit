This tool will get all the the status and ssh commands of you currently rented GPUs on the Hyperbolic platform.

It does not take any inputs

Important notes:
- Authorization key is required for this operation
- The GPU prices are in CENTS per hour
- If the status is "starting", it means the GPU is not ready yet. You can use the GetGPUStatus Action to check the status again after 5 seconds.
- You can access it through the SSHAccess Action and run commands on it through the RemoteShell Action.
